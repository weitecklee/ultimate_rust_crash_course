//
// Using `z.0` and `z.1` is not nearly as nice as using `x` and `y`.  Lucky for us, Rust supports
// destructuring function arguments.  Try replacing `z` in the parameter list below with `(x, y)`
// and then adjust the function body below to use `x` and `y` instead of `z.0` and `z.1`
//
// You should be able to run the code again and get the output as before.

// Challenge:
//
// Although types can often be inferred by the compiler, sometimes we write them out for clarity.
// Like we did with the `let coords: (f64, f64) = ...` declaration at the top of the `main`
// function.
//
// - Add the type annotation for the `series` variable in `main`.
// - Add the type annotation for the `mess` variable in `main`. (This may be a good example of why
//   it is nice to *not* have to add the type annotation! 😆)
